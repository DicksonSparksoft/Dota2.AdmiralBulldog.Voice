# Dota2.AdmiralBulldog.Voice

Jolly good morning Mister Bulldog. 

This is the viewer edition of the bot used by AdmiralBulldog during his Dota matches, AKA the thing that says classics such as `RoOOOOOones` and `Use your MIDAS`. This was made in collaboration with [DatGuy1](https://github.com/datguy1) who currently maintains the bot that Henrik uses.

All the sounds were taken from internal code or [The Playsound Page](http://chatbot.admiralbulldog.live/playsound).

This software is made so that you can add your own sounds to it if you so desire, effectively being some kind of template for other softwares like it. If you follow the naming conventions for the heroes, you should be able to add your own "on-game-join hero naming" voiceline (*i.e.* [this](https://i.nuuls.com/N8Wvj.mp3)).
